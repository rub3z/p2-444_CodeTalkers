For this project, we compiled and ran our code using NetBeans IDE Version 8.2.

Files: theInterpreter.java, parseIt.java, grammar.txt, input.txt

The goal of this project was to build a scope tree using an abstract syntax tree
generated from project #2. A complication was met when we didn't necessarily 
get around to building an AST in project #2.

Nonetheless, this assignment makes up for that and then some.
The parseIt.java file  has new and improved methods (worked on and conceived 
of with great effort by both Ruben and Eric) for creating the parse tree and 
AST. TheInterpreter.java file even (well, technically) runs a program! 
It successfully assigns a value to a variable with an appropriate entry in the
symtab of the first (well second - there's an empty global scope) scope.
You can see this result in the printout statements towards the end of the output
after running this program.
